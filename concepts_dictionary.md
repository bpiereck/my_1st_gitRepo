1. Git: Specific to a project, contains a timeline withing that project. Version control system in which one can control changes and return to previous states.

2. GitHub: Collection of different Gits. Is a cloud-based system that collects different Gits.

3. Conceptual areas:
    - Developing area: The folder where the git repository was initiated.
    
    - Staging area: Temporary, intermediary area to prepare the commit.

    This area is important because it alows to group chogether files semantic related and commit them together.git status

    - Local repository: The hidden '.git' file, where all the versions are tracked.

> What happens if I forget the `-m` in my commit?
Git will make me add a message by popping up an editor where I can write longer and more strucutred messages (paragraphs are allowed)

4. Files to ignore in GitHub
create a file called `.gitignore`, all listes files and folders will not be version-controled by Git, nor pushed to GitHub.

5. README.md file
Is the file to describe your project, tool in Git and GitHub. Very important and very good practice in RDM.git add

6. How to go from local to remote
You can do at any time of your project. You create 'a bridge' or connection, while to send commit trhough the brig you need to do it on a routine basis with `push`.

7. How to solve conflicts. 
Don't get into one in the first place.
I'M ADDING A CONFLIC BECAUSE I'M MEAN!

8. Working risk free

-Git branch: Create a new time-line with previous commints in common and following commits independent.
